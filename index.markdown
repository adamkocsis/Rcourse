# About the R-kheion 

*(**ἀρχεῖον*** [ar.kʰêː.on], *gr.: town hall, public building, public records)*


* * *

There are more than one ways to learn and do R programming, with lots of resources available on the internet. However, resources are not enough. There is a huge difference between *knowing how* to do something and *actually doing it*. Skills in solving problems are learned with exercising and exploration.

The purpose of this webste/book candidate is manyfold:

1. Provide gradual exposure to various topics of learning and using R and linking openly accessible material, whenever they are relevant.

2. Provide a compilation of exercises that ensure the acquisition of problem solving capabilities.

3. To introduce programming concepts that are applicable to most programming languages, without being **overly** technical.

Happy practicing!
