*(**ἀρχεῖον*** [ar.kʰêː.on], *gr.: town hall, public building, public records)*

* * *

There are more than one ways to learn and do R programming, with lots of resources are available on the internet. But resources are not enough. There is a huge difference between *knowing how* to do something and *actually doing it*. Skills in solving problems are learned with exercising and exploration.

The purpose of this webpage/book is twofold:

1. Provide gradual exposure various to topics of learning and using R, linking openly accessible material, whenever they are relevant.

2. Provide a compilation of exercises that ensure the acquisition of problem solving capabilities.
