Welcome! The course is designed primarily for Geoscientists. 

# Levels (sections)

The course is planned to represent 5 different levels of skills: 


### Level 1 - Total Novice

- This level is directed toward people who have no previous programming experience, or are completely novel to the R programming language.

- This section follows a single R script, explaining the contents of the code, and describing the functionality of the basic elements of the language. 

- The **objective** of this part is to ensure the acquisition of skills that help understanding and reading R code. 

- The material of this course is presented in the *Computers in Geosciences* course at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg.

### Level 2 - Advanced Beginner

- This level is directed towards beginners who have a basic understanding of the purpose and goal of R programming. The section contains a systematic treatise of the elements of the language, built up from
