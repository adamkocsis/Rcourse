## Instructions

Here is a bit of code that you can use to calculate exponents, with `a` being the base and `b` the exponent: 

```R
a^b
```

### Part 1

Given that `b` is an integer number, write a bit of code with a `while()` loop to calculate the exponent! Do not use the exponent/hat `^` and using only the multiplication `*` operator!

### Part 2

Make a function from the code you wrote earlier with the following parameters:

| name   | `Exp()`                            |
| params | `base`: the base of the expression |
|        | `ex` : the exponent                |
| return | The result.                        |
