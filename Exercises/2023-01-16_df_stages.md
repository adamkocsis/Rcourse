# Calculate the length of all Post Paleozoic geological periods

## Instructions

1. Download this file: [stages.csv]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/download/stages.csv)

2. Read it into R with `read.csv()`!

3. Subset to Mesozoic + Cenozoic!

4. Calculate the duration of every System/Period! You can do this with a `for()` loop. The duration of a period is the difference between the older boundary of its first stage and the younger boundary of its last stage.

5. Plot a histogram of the durations!

## Expected output

A named numeric vector:

names: periods/systems
values: durations in millions of years.
