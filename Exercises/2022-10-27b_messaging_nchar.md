## Instructions

#### Step 1

Make a variable called `text` that stores a characater string, for instance, this:

```
"This is a string!"
```

#### Step 2

Use a combination of `paste()`, `nchar()` and `message()` to display how many characters the string stored in `text` has in this format:

```
Your string 'This is a string!' contains 17 characters!
```

*Note that 17 be calculated from the string that you entered and not hard-coded in your program!* 

#### Step 3
Make sure to try it with another string!
