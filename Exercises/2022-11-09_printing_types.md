## Instructions

We have a variable `var` that includes a single value, such as:
```R
var <- 6
```

#### Part 1. 

Write a bit of code that prints out to the console the content of `var`, and its type in this format:

```
The variable 'var' contains the value '<value>', and it is of type '<type>'.
```

#### Part 2. 

Test your code with:

```R
var <- "code"
```

The result you should be

```
The variable 'var' contains the value 'code', and it is of type 'character'.
```

#### Part 3. 

Test your code with different types assigned to 'var', e.g.:

```R
var <- 1.2e4
var <- TRUE 
```
