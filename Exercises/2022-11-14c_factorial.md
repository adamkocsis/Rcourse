## Instructions

The [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a natural number (n!) is defined as such:

```
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 1 * 2
3! = 1 * 2 * 3
n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n
```

#### Part 1 - backbone

Write a bit of code using a `while()` loop to calculate n!

#### Part 2 - function

Make the code you produced in Part 1 a function that has the following characteristics:

|--------------|---------------------------------|
| name:        | `Fact()`                        |
| argument(s): | `n` `(numeric)`                 |
| return       | `numeric`, the factorial of `n` |


#### Part 3 - defense

Make a list of cases when the function has no meaning. Make sure that the function returns missing values when this is the case!
