# Consider these statements:

- If the temperature is below 15˚C, you should wear a jacket.

- If the weather is rainy you should wear a jacket in general, but only if the temperature is lower than 25˚C.  

For instance, for these parameters

```
# for example
temperature <- 17
raining <- FALSE
```

Should I wear a jacket or not? 

# Instructions

Implement a piece of code that calculates whether you need to wear a jacket or not based on any (realistic) values for temperature, and whether it rains or not? Use nested `if` statements to write this piece of code!
