## Instructions

The default output of `plot()` puts the y-axis on the left-hand side of the plot. Based on [this material]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/2_Advanced_Beginner/07_basic_plotting/the_plot_function.html):
1. Find which function is controlling the axes!
2. Look into its help file with `?`!
3. Make the plot shown on the page with the y-axis on the right-hand size!
