## Instructions

Based on the examples given earlier, write a function to calculate the volume of a sphere! The function should have the following charactersitics:

|--------------|----------------------------------|
| name         | VolumeSphere()                   |
| argument(s)  | radius                           |
| return value | single numeric value: the volume |

You can find the relevant formula [on this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere)!

*Hint: the value of Ï€ is actually built into R, you can access it anytime with*

```Rd
pi
```

*Use this for your function!*
