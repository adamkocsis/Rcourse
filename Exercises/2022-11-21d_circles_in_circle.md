## Instructions

#### Part 1
Write a bit of code to recreate this plot:

![img]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/circles_in_circle.png)



Some hints to understanding what is happening here:
1. Use/write a function that plots a single circle from points, for instance the result of [this exercise]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/Exercises/2022-11-21b_draw_circle.html).
2. There are 18 circles plotted, with a 'resolution' of 1° (a point is plotted at every whole-degree angle)
3. The origins of the circles are also positioned according to a circle (20° apart, with the same radius as the actually plotted circles).

#### Part 2

Experiment with setting a different radius (either for the origins or for the actual circles). 

#### Part 3

Modify your script to make it possible to change the color of every large circle!
