## Instructions

Here is this simple R code:

```R
a <- 5
b <- 4
result <- a * b
```

Assuming that we do not know how to multiply with `*`, we can still calculate `result` with addition and iteration
(Multiplication is achieved with the iteration of addition):

```
3 * 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
```

Write a `while()` loop to calculate `result` above, without using the the multiplication operator `*`!
