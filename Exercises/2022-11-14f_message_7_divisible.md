## Instructions

#### Part 1

Using a `while()` loop, write a bit of code that prints out all values between 1 and 1000, but only when they are divisible by 7!

#### Part 2

Based on the code that you just wrote, write a function that allows you to print out all values up to a positive integer (n) that are divisible by an integer (x)!

| name:      | Multiples()                                 |
| arguments: | `x`: the numbers will be multiples of       |
|            | `n`: the largest number that can be printed |
| return:    | -                                           |
