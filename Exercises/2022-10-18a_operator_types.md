# Operator types and operands

Experiment with the combination of different operand types and operators!

Fill out the table below, indicating the type that is returned when you use an operator with an operand type! For instance, using `==` operator with numeric operands results in a logical value.

```r
8 == 6 
```

### Table of combinations

|           | logical | numeric | character | logical-numeric | numeric-character |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `!`       |         |         |           | N/A             | N/A               |
| `==`      |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `>`, `<=` |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `|`       |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `+`       |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `-`       |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `*`       |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `/`       |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `**`, `^` |         |         |           |                 |                   |
| `%%`      |         |         |           |                 |                   |

If a combination leads to an error, indicate that an error is returned!

*Hint: copy the table to a spreadsheet program or a text editor!*
