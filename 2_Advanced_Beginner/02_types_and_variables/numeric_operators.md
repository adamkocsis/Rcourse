# Some numeric operators

As their name suggests, numeric operators produce numbers. Their usual input is also numbers.

## Unary operators

The minus/hypen operator is reversing the sign of any number, regardless whether it is positive or negative:

```R
x <- 10
-x
```

## Binary operators

Usual mathematical operations are implemented as binary operators:

| Operator                 | Operation        | Effect                               |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| *a* `+` *b*              | addition         | The sum of two numbers               |
| *a* `-` *b*              | subtraction      | The difference of two numbers        |
| *a* `*` *b*              | multiplication   | The product of two numbers           |
| *a* `/` *b*              | decimal division | The ratio of two numbers             |
| *a* `%%` *b*             | modulus          | The remainder after integer division |
| *a* `^` *b*, *a* `**`*b* | exponetiation    | *a* raised to the power of *b*       |
