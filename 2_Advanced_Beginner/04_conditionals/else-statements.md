# Why?

So far we have looked at statements that were executed when a condition was fulfilled, but nothing happened when it was not:

```R
# input has to be number
input <- 12
if(input>=0) result <- "Awesome!"
message(result)
```

In this case, if I enter a negative value as `input`, 

In many cases, conditions indicate exclusive directions
